        "   - The length of the box shows the **interquartile range (IQR)**, or the spread of the middle 50% of the data.\n",
        "   - A **larger box** (larger IQR) indicates that the middle 50% of the data points are spread out. A **smaller box** suggests that the middle 50% of the data are concentrated around the median.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Whiskers**:\n",
        "   - The whiskers indicate how far the **non-outlier data points** extend. If the whiskers are relatively short, the data points are concentrated around the center. Long whiskers indicate that the data points are more spread out.\n",
        "   - The whiskers can help indicate if there is **skewness** in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Outliers**:\n",
        "   - Outliers are represented by dots or symbols outside the whiskers. These values are significantly higher or lower than the rest of the data and may indicate unusual or special cases.\n",

        "#### **2. Skewness:**\n",
        "   - By observing the position of the median relative to the box, you can detect whether the data is **skewed**:\n",
        "     - If the median is closer to **Q1** than to **Q3**, the data is **right-skewed** (positively skewed).\n",

        "\n",

        "   - The **IQR** (the width of the box) tells you about the **spread** or **variability** of the middle 50% of the data.\n",
        "   - The **length of the whiskers** indicates how much the data extends beyond the central quartiles.\n",
        "   \n",
        "#### **4. Presence of Outliers:**\n",

In the presence of skewness, especially with outliers, the mean may be significantly affected and may not represent the \"typical\" value of the data. For example, in a positively skewed income distribution, the mean income will be higher than most people's income due to the influence of a few very high incomes.\n",
